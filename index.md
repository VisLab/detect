### DETECT overview  
DETECT is a MATLAB™ Toolbox for the detection and identification of events in long multi-channel time series.
Given training data of the events of interest and a feature extraction technique, DETECT can be used to train a
classification model and label continuous time series data. Our motivation for developing DETECT was primarily
for the analysis of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals.  

### Requirements and installation  
The requirements to run DETECT are:  

- MATLAB™ version R2011A or higher. Other versions of MATLAB™ may work; version R2011A and later are officially supported.
- EEGLAB version 10 or higher, if you wish to use the DETECT plotting functions.

To install:  
- Download the toolbox and extract to your desired directory.   
- Add the extracted folder to the MATLAB™ Path (File → Set Path). Use the “Add with Subfolders” option.  
- Add EEGLAB and its subfolders to the MATLAB™ Path if you wish to use the DETECT plotting functions.
