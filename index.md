### DETECT overview  
DETECT is a MATLAB™ Toolbox for the detection and identification of events in long multi-channel time series. 
Given training data of the events of interest and a feature extraction technique, DETECT can be used to train a 
classification model and label continuous time series data. Our motivation for developing DETECT was primarily 
for the analysis of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals.  

### Requirements and installation  
The requirements to run DETECT are:  

- MATLAB™ version R2011A or higher. Other versions of MATLAB™ may work; version R2011A and later are officially supported.
- EEGLAB version 10 or higher, if you wish to use the DETECT plotting functions.

```
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

### Rather Drive Stick?
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
